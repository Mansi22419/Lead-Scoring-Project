# Lead-Scoring-Project
Lead Scoring Project 
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. 
X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.
If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.
The company wants  us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
 The CEO, wants to achieve a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
They want the model to be able to handle future constraints as well like Peak time actions required, how to utilize full man power and after achieving target what should be the approaches.
